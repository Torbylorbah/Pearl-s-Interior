00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:51,301
<i>Applying mascara can drastically change
the appearance of a woman,</i>

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>and we will show you that
through this live show.</i>

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>When a woman has long and curly eyelashes,</i>

4
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,852
<i>it makes her look sensual, feminine,</i>

5
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>-and it also brings out her sexiness.
-Yes.</i>

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>That's why people call Blanche</i>

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>a sexy mascara.</i>

8
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,550
Damn it.

9
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,890
You guys can have them.

10
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,853
You have a friend who's a cosmetics
shop manager at a department store.

11
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,439
And that friend is right here.

12
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,358
Why do you keep doing this?

13
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,692
Eyes are very important

14
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,195
-for women our age.
-Says who?

15
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,446
The internet.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,657
I knew home shopping was a scam.

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,494
Practice with them.
These aren't the problem. It's your skill.

18
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:03,289
I told you. You're better off
spending your money on food.

19
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,541
Come here.

20
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,918
-Try it on me.
-Whatever.

21
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,796
Hey. You're very wise.

22
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,259
Here. Don't start from the bottom.

23
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,219
-I thought it was for me.
-You do this.

24
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,555
-Watch this.
-She's pretty even without mascara.

25
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,766
ONE ABSURD DAY

26
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,687
{\an8}EPISODE 2

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,629
{\an8}I can't believe this.

28
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,528
This should've been our first encounter.

29
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,573
We had quite a ride.

30
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,246
I'm actually relieved.

31
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,750
If this was our first encounter,

32
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,836
all that's happened
might have never happened.

33
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,672
Because I liked the time…

34
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,426
I spent with you, Dr. Cha.

35
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,678
Okay, how about this?

36
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,680
We're not in our twenties.

37
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,682
It was an understandable accident.

38
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,144
This is just how we were supposed to meet.

39
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
I'm a doctor entrusting you
with running my clinic,

40
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,441
and you're the doctor
who'll fill in for me for a year.

41
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,944
Let's settle it at that and start over.

42
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,160
Okay. Sounds good.

43
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,537
Okay.

44
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,373
That's a relief.

45
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,333
But just one thing.

46
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,168
What?

47
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
It wasn't an accident.

48
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,632
Well, at least it wasn't for me.

49
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,009
It's been a long time since…

50
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,012
Gosh, how should I put it?

51
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,432
Anyway, it wasn't an accident.

52
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,071
Well, what I meant to say is…

53
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,533
I think we should
begin talking about the clinic.

54
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,118
Sure. I'm fine with anything.

55
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,554
Please.

56
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,437
Mi-jo is going to take
a sabbatical before she turns 40.

57
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,731
So I…

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,693
thought about what
I should change in my life

59
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,570
before I turn 40.

60
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,947
We've had this

61
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,368
vague and sad relationship for a while,
and I think we should end it.

62
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,333
How about only quitting smoking?

63
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,668
Just end it at that.

64
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,045
If you quit both,

65
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,880
the withdrawal symptoms will be tough.

66
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,841
Holding out like this is already so hard.

67
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,766
Is it because of Ju-won?

68
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,979
We can just live with him.

69
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,482
Jin-seok, I promise…

70
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,485
I promise I'll be a good mom.

71
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,695
Chan-young.

72
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,452
My gosh, I'm a horrible person.
I must be out of my mind.

73
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,123
I'm trying to make

74
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,876
his parents get divorced for my sake.

75
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,506
I must be insane.

76
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,138
I'm the one to blame.

77
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,723
I am.

78
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,276
You can't even ask me to stay with you.

79
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,030
I feel bad for you.

80
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,011
I'll see you at the clinic.
You know where it is, right?

81
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,638
Yes, Jin-seok sent me the link.

82
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,476
Can I ask you something?

83
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,688
Sure.

84
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,023
Why work in Korea
with such an impressive resume?

85
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,859
It must've been hard to pass the KMLE.

86
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,865
I couldn't just turn 40 like this.

87
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,164
There's something I have to do.

88
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,877
And it's something
you have to do in Korea?

89
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,962
At the moment, yes, I believe so.

90
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,799
I see.

91
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,431
Goodbye then.

92
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,443
You don't need to do this.

93
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,986
I can take care of myself.

94
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,571
It's just manners.

95
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,199
Bye.

96
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,397
Are you open?

97
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:46,859
Hello.

98
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,112
We're opening tomorrow.

99
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,365
Oh.

100
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:57,161
When do you close?

101
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,081
Oh, we close at 8:00 p.m.

102
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,793
If you come tomorrow,
the <i>gochu japchae</i> will be on the house.

103
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,628
Please come.

104
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,341
I get off work past 8:00 p.m.

105
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,889
Do you know where the owner went?

106
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,433
Oh, me?

107
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,313
I'm right here.

108
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,233
Oh, not you. I was talking

109
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:31,195
about the owner
of the previous restaurant.

110
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,282
Oh, I see. No, I don't know.

111
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,284
I liked their dried pollack.

112
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,827
Our food is delicious too.

113
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,037
But you close at 8:00 p.m.

114
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,083
The previous owner closed pretty late,

115
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,543
so I came by…

116
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,628
pretty often.

117
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,008
Good luck with your business.

118
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,135
Thank you. Bye.

119
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,195
Let me see your eyes.

120
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,662
Gosh, this mascara
is actually pretty good.

121
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,830
Normally, you'd look like a panda.

122
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,626
I watched carefully
when they sold this on TV.

123
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,587
It's waterproof. You need to take it off.

124
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,547
It's sexy mascara.

125
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,342
How can you be joking right now?

126
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,811
Did the talk go well?

127
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,357
Yes.

128
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,901
What did Jin-seok say?

129
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,490
I'm worried.

130
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,951
He'll have a hard time.

131
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,120
What about you?

132
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,791
Can't you tell by how much
the sexy mascara smudged?

133
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,053
Sleep over.

134
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,847
Then I'm taking the bed.

135
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,308
Must you go to the States?

136
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,857
I want to take a break.

137
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,821
Fine.

138
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,160
I know how hard you've been working.

139
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,621
Come with me.

140
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,125
Being near Jin-seok
will only make it harder for you.

141
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,837
I'll treat you much better than he did.

142
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,466
Hey, that's just
burying our heads in the sand.

143
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,759
I'll think of him wherever I am.

144
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,761
I spent my thirties with him.

145
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,311
Right.

146
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,211
-Where's Ju-won?
-He said he was going to bed but…

147
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,502
Did you eat?

148
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,004
Yes, I did. I'm going to take a shower.

149
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,156
<i>Peonies.</i>

150
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,911
They'll be in full bloom by tomorrow.
They have a killer scent.

151
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,249
Can I have one of them?

152
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,216
So the watch guy

153
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,177
turned out to be the doctor?

154
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,431
It's really frustrating.

155
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,282
Is it okay if I soothe my heartache

156
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,451
by congratulating your new beginning?

157
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,620
What do you mean?

158
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,997
Hey.

159
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,586
I must say,
this is a really nice way to start things.

160
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,380
I mean, think about it.

161
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,508
Two people meeting,
seeing if they like each other,

162
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,470
and trying to figure out
if they're right for each other.

163
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,763
It's exhausting, right?

164
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,518
I like how fast things are going for you.

165
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,438
Are you seriously excited?

166
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,815
Didn't you break up today?

167
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,575
You don't have to be so damn blunt.

168
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,039
Sleep on the floor.

169
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,585
You said I could sleep on the bed.

170
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,504
No way. Right now,

171
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,716
my entire body aches
because you hit me with the sad reality.

172
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,220
You'll be fine sleeping on the floor
since your heart is fluttering.

173
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Hey.

174
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,599
My heart isn't fluttering.

175
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,145
We're past that age now.
We just slept together once.

176
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,149
We may be turning 40 soon,
but we're not emotionless.

177
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,277
I got excited just by hearing it.

178
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,488
You sleep here. Okay?

179
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,699
Darn it.

180
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,410
<i>Where are you?</i>

181
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,621
<i>You just passed by.
Turn around and come back…</i>

182
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,791
<i>Hello?</i>

183
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

184
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,005
Yes?

185
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,467
That's enough.
You'll have to pee in your sleep.

186
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,593
This is my last can.

187
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,220
You already finished four cans?

188
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,514
Why do you always drink like a fish?

189
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,434
What can I do? I'm good at handling it.

190
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,770
I gave birth to a heavy drinker.

191
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,023
Like father, like daughter.

192
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,774
-Go to bed.
-Okay.

193
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,323
My gosh, he's so hot.

194
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,782
Why aren't you sleeping?

195
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,035
I have no sleeping pills.

196
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,538
Can't you sleep without them?

197
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,707
No.

198
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,879
Has it been a while?

199
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,966
Yes.

200
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,432
Get some good rest abroad…

201
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,685
so you can sleep without them.

202
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,571
Mi-jo.

203
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,367
I think your boobs have gotten bigger.

204
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,454
You loony.

205
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,831
Come on.

206
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,290
Let's go sleep.

207
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,168
-Come on.
-Okay.

208
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,881
This is Doctor Kim Seon-u.
He'll be working with us starting today.

209
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,507
You should say hello.

210
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,509
I look forward to it.

211
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,560
Was I supposed to introduce myself
starting from my date of birth?

212
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,395
That's unnecessary. Are you married?

213
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm single.

214
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,359
Now I want to know your date of birth.

215
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,069
Are you younger than Dr. Cha?

216
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,198
What makes you think he's younger than me?

217
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,074
I can tell you're a dermatologist.

218
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,993
You have the skin of a 20-year-old.

219
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,703
I only apply toner.

220
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,956
Don't say that.
It'll make us run out of business.

221
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,958
"Toner is all I use
to maintain good skin."

222
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,544
No one will come to a dermatology clinic.

223
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,006
Ms. Cha, stop trying to intimidate him.

224
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,888
Ms. Cha will introduce you
to the medical equipment we use.

225
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,598
If you have any questions…

226
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:25,515
-I do.
-I do.

227
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,810
Ask him during your personal time.
I think that's enough for an introduction.

228
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,812
Let's have a good one, everyone.

229
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,815
Where's my office?

230
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,108
I'll show you where it is.

231
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,790
He seems decent.

232
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,375
-How old is he?
-The same age as me.

233
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,669
Good luck.

234
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,338
-With what?
-With everything.

235
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,133
I'm leaving soon, okay?

236
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,178
These days, a lot of clinics
have multiple doctors.

237
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,806
Just stay. You can work less hard.

238
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,723
No.

239
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,768
When will you tell Mom and Dad?

240
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:10,936
Soon.

241
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,023
Goodness!

242
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,703
I just said goodbye to my friend.

243
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,330
Yes. Right now? The department store.

244
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,374
I ran out of serum, so I came to buy one.

245
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,753
What? No, it's okay. I'll buy my own.

246
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,175
Your card? Oh, right. I have it.

247
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,845
Seriously?
Can I really buy it with your card?

248
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,181
Then can I get
a luxury item instead of a serum?

249
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,393
Why are you stuttering?

250
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,479
Okay. I'll see you later.

251
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,440
Bye.

252
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,318
Do you need a serum?

253
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,111
Yes. What's good?

254
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,237
Here.

255
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,239
Here you go.

256
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,158
Thank you. Enjoy the product.

257
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,492
Thank you.

258
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,036
Bye.

259
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,002
She gets to buy stuff
with her boyfriend's card. I'm jealous.

260
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,421
Should I give you my card?

261
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,505
Sure.

262
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,590
My goodness.

263
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,859
Your swing comes down too hastily.

264
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,904
I waited a bit before the swing.

265
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,240
Stop for a bit longer.

266
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,910
Then do your swing. Try it again.

267
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,869
Okay.

268
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,210
Better, right?

269
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,171
Your swing is stable.
Just forget about the distance.

270
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,173
It's hard to forget about it.

271
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,010
Excuse me for a second.

272
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,557
Hey.

273
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,518
Yes.

274
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,063
Oh, really? That's quicker than expected.

275
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,899
Yes. Me and two of my friends.

276
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,569
Thanks a lot.

277
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,655
We'll make sure we fast.

278
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,032
I'll treat you to a meal. Thanks.

279
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,005
Doesn't it get cold in the winter?

280
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,678
Doesn't it get chilly
because it's on the basement floor?

281
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,933
Why are you here?

282
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,643
Oh, right.

283
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,953
I'm sure you know.
It's an art school in Paris.

284
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,330
You wanted to study more.

285
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,957
You're 40 soon. You should go.

286
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,293
No.

287
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,589
I can't speak French or English.

288
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,965
You can learn there.

289
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,050
What's the matter with you?

290
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,430
Mi-jo wants me to follow her to the US,
and you want me to study abroad.

291
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,182
I'm one lucky girl.

292
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,810
Better yet, why don't you come with me?

293
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,817
Chan-young.

294
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,278
You were right.

295
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,615
Quitting two things at once is too hard.

296
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,745
You're making me want to smoke again.

297
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,714
Chan-young, why am I so indecisive?

298
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,258
You realize that now?

299
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,762
I know, right?

300
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,226
It was me.

301
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,479
I carried this on for too long.

302
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,362
Don't worry about me. You can go.

303
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,633
You really do get off work late.

304
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,514
Me?

305
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:01,142
I extended our business hours
for my neighbor's sake.

306
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,519
But you didn't even come.

307
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,439
You did that for me?

308
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,525
<i>Is this…</i>

309
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:12,195
<i>what being hit on feels like?</i>

310
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,115
Actually, the district chief suggested it.

311
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,284
Oh, I see.

312
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,787
Come and try the <i>gochu japchae</i>.
It's on the house.

313
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,498
I have a medical checkup tomorrow,

314
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,375
so I can't eat anything.

315
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,585
I'll come this weekend with my friends.

316
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,087
Okay. Please do.

317
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,422
-Okay.
-Okay.

318
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,465
-Bye.
-Bye.

319
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,759
Bye.

320
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,849
Why did he even talk to me
if he wasn't hitting on me?

321
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,198
Come in.

322
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,038
Gosh, this is…

323
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,915
You'll have to treat
the patients on your own today.

324
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,083
What about Dr. Cha?

325
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,960
She's getting a medical checkup.

326
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,088
She wants to get a full checkup
before she leaves for the States.

327
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,592
She really is composed and clever.

328
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,260
I'm not so sure.

329
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,429
You two seem really close.

330
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,558
-Do you have a younger sibling?
-Yes.

331
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,476
Is he or she nice?

332
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,894
Yes, I guess.

333
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,481
Well, Mi-jo is the complete opposite
of that. You get what I mean, right?

334
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,441
Have a good one.

335
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,741
Ms. Cha…

336
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,035
and Cha Mi-jo.

337
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,039
I see.

338
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,458
HANKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

339
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,170
Don't you think the restaurant owner
was hitting on you?

340
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,505
He changed his business hours.

341
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,007
He said the district chief suggested it.

342
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,385
Freebies are normally fried dumplings.

343
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,721
But he offered <i>gochu japchae</i>.
That means it's love.

344
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,765
<i>Gochu japchae</i> means it's love?

345
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,142
Don't put ideas in her head.

346
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,395
Let's go there after we're done.

347
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,813
I'll buy you <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

348
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,148
I told him I'd go with my friends.

349
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,819
Let's just go and eat there
so I can walk by in peace.

350
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,405
<i>Gochu japchae</i> does sound pretty nice--

351
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,532
No, we can't eat anything greasy today.

352
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,910
Gosh, come on.
Let's go take a look at him.

353
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,787
He hit on Joo-hee.

354
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,622
Gosh, he didn't hit on me.

355
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,751
Maybe a little bit.
It's hard to say, isn't it?

356
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,212
-Yes, very much.
-It's time to draw your blood.

357
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,840
-Okay.
-Start with her

358
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,883
-who recently got hit on.
-Stop it.

359
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,349
-I'm telling you. I'm right.
-Just drop it.

360
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,374
He looks young.

361
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,544
It's fine if he's less
than ten years younger.

362
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,337
Can we talk about this later?

363
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,436
Hi. Hello.

364
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:37,317
Why did you bow so many times?
What are you, a bobblehead?

365
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,319
You guys are making me nervous.

366
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,113
You have a long way to go.
This is nothing.

367
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,408
You got this.

368
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,994
We'll try to come up with a plan.

369
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,872
So don't drink too much.
Don't get drunk and ruin it.

370
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,373
She's right. I'm worried.

371
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,417
You live nearby,
so don't drink for a while.

372
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,419
Gosh, will you guys stop it?

373
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,588
What if he's too young?

374
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,757
Didn't you hear Mi-jo?

375
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,092
It's fine if he's less
than ten years younger.

376
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:09,849
Hi!

377
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,059
Hey, you're here.

378
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,310
Do you need help?

379
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,978
No, it's okay. Just have a seat.

380
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,439
Hey, look what I bought.

381
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,316
Oh.

382
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,908
-Thank you for this.
-Sure.

383
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,373
Let's have some Kaoliang liquor.

384
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,374
-Yes.
-Why?

385
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,959
If you score a goal, you win.

386
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,461
That's a strong defense.

387
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,796
Then strike harder.

388
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,257
Yes? Do you need anything?

389
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,550
Well…

390
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,510
A bottle of Kaoliang liquor, please.

391
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,095
-Okay.
-Sure!

392
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,596
I'll get it.

393
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,783
Here you go.

394
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,709
Do you need anything else?

395
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,961
What? Well…

396
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,630
You're pretty.

397
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,884
Thank you.

398
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,801
Sure.

399
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,472
"You're pretty"? You're unbelievable.

400
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,610
Alcohol is the best way
to cleanse your body.

401
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,362
I'm getting dizzy.
I haven't eaten anything.

402
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,198
What's there to worry about?
Call the watch guy.

403
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,247
I'm going to get drunk and puke on you.

404
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,625
I'll use it to give you a facial.

405
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,126
-Thanks.
-Sure.

406
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,669
Stop it. We're about to eat.

407
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,007
-You're working hard.
-Hey, you came.

408
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,425
I got hungry.

409
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,594
-Grab a table. I have orders piled up.
-Hey…

410
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,845
-Sure. Take your time.
-Okay.

411
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,931
I must be drunk.

412
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,140
Did you call him?

413
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,726
Hye-jin, it's been so long.

414
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,353
Long time no see, Seon-u.

415
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,492
Mi-jo?

416
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,785
"Mi-jo"?

417
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,453
Gosh.

418
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,371
Hey.

419
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,373
Mi-jo.

420
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,834
Hey.

421
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,214
My friend lives nearby.

422
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,050
Enjoy your meal.

423
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,177
If you're here alone, why don't--

424
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,846
Don't hurt your friend like that.

425
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,684
We ordered <i>yangjangpi</i>.

426
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,979
<i>Yangjangpi</i>? I really like <i>yangjangpi</i>.

427
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,023
I don't want Mi-jo…

428
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,776
I mean, I don't want Dr. Cha
to feel uncomfortable.

429
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,696
If he sits alone,
it'll be even more awkward.

430
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,948
Come join us.

431
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,760
Can we get one more spoon
and a pair of chopsticks, please?

432
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,054
Sure.

433
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,226
Then I guess I'll have to join you guys.

434
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,065
Gosh.

435
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,825
Fate must've brought us all together.

436
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,287
Do you know the owner of this restaurant?

437
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,997
Yes, he's a good friend.

438
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,914
I see.

439
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,752
I heard you and Mi-jo
work at the same clinic.

440
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,503
Well, she is

441
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,464
my employer.

442
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,885
Employer? Gosh, I'm getting tipsy.

443
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,553
When can we get our food?

444
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,763
It's almost ready.

445
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,266
Dr. Cha, go easy on the alcohol.

446
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,313
MY ROMANTIC DAD

447
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:26,939
Hey.

448
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,024
It's your dad.

449
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,319
Aren't you going to pick up?

450
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,321
Damn it. Did Mi-hyeon tell him?

451
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,371
Hello, my admirable father.

452
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,757
Hey, Dad. I'm in the middle of something--

453
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,179
I just picked up my purse.

454
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,223
I'm leaving now.

455
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,140
Bye.

456
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,276
What's up?

457
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,281
I still haven't told my parents yet.

458
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,617
Stay sober.

459
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,120
-Do you want me to call you a cab?
-Yes.

460
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,371
Let me drive you home.

461
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,872
It's okay.

462
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,332
Samseong-dong. Near COEX Mall.

463
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,708
Do you want the address?

464
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,793
Hey.

465
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,046
See you at the clinic.

466
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,631
See you guys.

467
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,931
I'll treat you next time.

468
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:50,106
Do you also think
Mi-jo shouldn't go to the States?

469
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:54,527
Obviously. Why waste her time there
when she can have fun here?

470
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,677
You haven't eaten since your checkup.

471
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,346
Thanks.

472
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,812
Is your father strict?

473
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,232
-Not really.
-Then are you an obedient daughter?

474
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,652
But your sister told me
that you're the opposite of that.

475
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,820
My sister said that?

476
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,339
Aren't you on your way to getting scolded?

477
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,008
What?

478
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,594
Right here.

479
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,767
Goodness.

480
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,914
Goodbye.

481
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,959
Thank you for the ride.
I'll see you tomorrow.

482
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,043
Okay.

483
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,127
Bye, then.

484
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,803
Bye.

485
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,225
I bet she still smells of alcohol.

486
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:56,983
Cha Mi-jo.

487
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,444
Dad, I have no energy.

488
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,863
I haven't eaten anything
because of a checkup.

489
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,617
You called right when we were
about to get the <i>yangjangpi</i>.

490
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,078
You drank on an empty stomach?

491
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,249
Let's grill some beef.

492
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,002
Should we?

493
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,515
I feel much better now.

494
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,488
Dad. Mom.

495
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,116
You see…

496
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:48,659
You can go.

497
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,662
-What?
-Go and get some rest.

498
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,707
Dad…

499
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,502
When our bodies get sick,
we either get surgery or take medicine.

500
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,006
When our minds get sick,
we should get good rest.

501
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,386
When did you start having panic attacks?

502
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,683
I did what I had to do
as your older sister.

503
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,811
I tried to come up with something else,
but they wouldn't buy it.

504
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,938
I had no choice
but to tell them the truth.

505
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,900
It's not that serious.

506
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,070
Thank goodness you chose
to take a break before it got serious.

507
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,615
I'll go with you.

508
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,367
-What?
-Me too.

509
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,077
All hell has broken loose.

510
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,371
Gosh, you guys can't come with me.

511
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,998
It's like going clubbing with my parents.

512
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,625
I'd rather have you go clubbing.

513
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,586
I'm too old to grind at a club.

514
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,381
Honey, let's have some wine.

515
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,758
I feel down.

516
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,551
Dad.

517
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,930
<i>That day, it was raining cats and dogs</i>

518
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,849
<i>I was sitting inside an old coffee shop</i>

519
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,394
If you leave,

520
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,063
who's going to sing "About Romance"?

521
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,189
I'll call you.

522
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,524
Let us come with you.

523
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,234
Then I won't go.

524
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,071
That's even better. You can rest here.

525
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,656
Stop it.

526
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,158
Just take me with you.

527
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,413
Why are you smiling?

528
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,415
Am I not allowed to?

529
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,721
What…

530
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,391
Come on.

531
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,352
Seriously?

532
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,691
The number is…

533
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,741
Hello.
Your license plate number is 7193, right?

534
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
Can you move your car for me?

535
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:02,126
You parked your car like this
and went on a business trip?

536
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,088
When will you be back?

537
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,268
Wait!

538
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,146
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

539
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,191
Did you run?

540
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,067
Yes, from the subway station.

541
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,029
Someone blocked my car.

542
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:34,450
I see. But you're not late.

543
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,745
I wanted you to have
a good impression of me.

544
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,706
I'm not that strict.

545
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,585
How was the scolding yesterday?

546
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,756
It would've been better
if they actually scolded me.

547
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,008
By the way, thanks for yesterday.

548
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,552
It was nice. I got to go for a drive.

549
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,887
I'll treat you to a meal.

550
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,971
I'd love that.

551
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,959
JIN-SEOK

552
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,533
Did you skip golfing?

553
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,707
Can our actors still work with you?

554
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,668
You came to ask me that?

555
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,712
At least finish what you're working on.

556
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,636
You're a great agency CEO.

557
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,389
Also, try to reconsider.
Don't be emotional.

558
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:23,934
I was always emotional.
I'm finally starting to think rationally.

559
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,021
I'll continue working with the three
until their shoot ends.

560
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,273
Don't worry, and go. I need to sleep.

561
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,733
Let's eat first.

562
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,696
Will you please stop?
You're making me waver.

563
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,032
Just eat. You need to eat to stay healthy.

564
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,284
What's the point?
We're all going to die anyway.

565
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,119
Stop talking that way.

566
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,162
Whatever.

567
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,789
Just go.

568
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,129
Aren't you going?

569
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,594
Get in.

570
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,971
Looking like this? Seriously?

571
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,350
That's the best you've looked lately.

572
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:10,898
I'm not eating.

573
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,942
I won't say anything. I promise.

574
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,029
Just eat and go back to sleep.

575
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,530
Do it for me. I'm hungry.

576
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,708
This meal is way too fancy
for someone who just woke up.

577
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,297
I won't bother you.

578
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,007
I won't give you false hope.

579
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,427
But to me,
you'll always be Mi-jo's best friend.

580
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,054
So we can't just cut ties.

581
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,224
You're indecisive with everything

582
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,267
except for two things.

583
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,185
What are they?

584
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,853
Managing actors

585
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,897
and making sure I stay in your life.

586
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,361
Just eat.

587
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,573
-The porridge is easy on the stomach.
-You need to go easy on me.

588
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,660
You never listen to me,

589
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,995
and it stresses me out so much.

590
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,935
CAR RENTAL

591
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,729
Come in.

592
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,943
I think we should separate our patients.

593
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,112
Okay, I'll take that. I see.

594
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,535
Are you renting a car?

595
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:53,459
I'm going to Gapyeong tonight
with my sister to eat dumpling soup,

596
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,043
but my car is still blocked.

597
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,920
That guy still isn't back?

598
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,464
He's on a business trip.

599
00:45:58,547 --> 00:45:59,506
My gosh.

600
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,676
You're going all the way
to Gapyeong for dumpling soup?

601
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,761
My little sister loves dumplings.

602
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,348
Goodness, you're very sweet.

603
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,352
Hey, you can use my car.
Don't worry about the insurance.

604
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,272
It's okay. I'll just rent a car.

605
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,608
You drove me yesterday,
so I'm paying you back.

606
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,235
Just park the car
in the clinic parking lot after.

607
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,615
Then I guess
I should thank you in advance.

608
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,867
Like I said, I'm paying you back.

609
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,951
Thank you.

610
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,919
RACHMANINOV: PIANO CONCERTO

611
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,770
So-won.

612
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:58,106
What? Seon-u, did you get a new car?

613
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,275
No, I borrowed it. Get in.

614
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,153
Did yours break down?

615
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,155
No, it's a long story. Let's get going.

616
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,949
-Ready?
-Yes.

617
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,039
Nice music, right?

618
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,582
Rachmaninoff again?

619
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,168
It's the car owner's playlist.

620
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,503
Isn't it nice?

621
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,713
I'm sick of Rachmaninoff now.

622
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,050
But not dumplings, right?

623
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,176
I love them.

624
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,394
I got a job.

625
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,812
Really? At a hospital?

626
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,772
At a dermatology clinic in Gangnam.

627
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,274
Hey, that's great.

628
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,859
How is it there? Do you like it?

629
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,403
Everyone's really nice.

630
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,781
Is your roommate okay?

631
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,742
Yes. Very kind.

632
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,995
Let me buy you guys a meal.

633
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,538
-She's your friend--
-No.

634
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,999
I'm doing fine, Seon-u.

635
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,126
You're making me
feel like I'm being watched.

636
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,545
Really? I'm sorry.

637
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,509
Does Father know?

638
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,136
Know what?

639
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,804
That we hang out like this.

640
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,808
What kind of question is that?

641
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,978
What's wrong with two siblings eating
and watching shows together?

642
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,146
It's natural.

643
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,775
But I'm no longer your little sister.

644
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,458
You will always be my little sister.

645
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,586
I remember everything about you

646
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,964
from when you were little until now.

647
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,011
You came to Korea
because of me, didn't you?

648
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,142
I was tired of my job in the States too.

649
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:01,063
I wish Mom were still alive.

650
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,736
I dream about her a lot these days.

651
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,741
Don't you miss her too?

652
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,121
I miss her too.

653
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,421
Next time, we should go
to an observatory in Yeongwol.

654
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,674
I heard the stars
look beautiful from there.

655
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,843
No. I'm going to be a bit busy now.

656
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,261
Are you trying to get rich?

657
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,931
Is the piano academy keeping you busy?

658
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,016
Yes, I'm tutoring for a competition.

659
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,644
I see. Okay.

660
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,313
Then let's just eat
something nice near the academy.

661
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,815
It's in Banpo, right?

662
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,983
No, I'll just go to your clinic.

663
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,487
Sure, that'd be nice.

664
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,532
-Eat up.
-Okay.

665
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,373
Seon-u, drop me off over there.

666
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,166
No, I'll drive you home.

667
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,627
No, I have to meet someone.
I'll just get out there.

668
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,296
Okay, then.

669
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,887
-Seon-u.
-Yes?

670
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,181
Thank you.

671
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,100
Stop it. Don't be gross.

672
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,560
I just wanted to thank you.

673
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,520
See you.

674
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,273
Take care!

675
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,573
You're still here?

676
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,908
I practiced putting.

677
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,451
I see.

678
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,287
Did you enjoy the meal?

679
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,539
Well, yes.

680
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,919
Would you like some wine?

681
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,925
Don't tell my sister. I hid this from her.

682
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,222
I have a lot to thank you for today.
For both the car and wine.

683
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,891
I actually wanted to drink today.

684
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,145
I could tell. You seemed a little down.

685
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,397
Did you fight with your sister?

686
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,108
That would've been better.

687
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,157
This is nice.

688
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,578
After I came to Korea
and studied for the KMLE,

689
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,163
I was mostly alone.

690
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,335
I bet I've looked like this pretty often.

691
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,673
It's nice to have someone who notices it.

692
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,302
Is there something
that often brings you down?

693
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,059
My little sister…

694
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:29,729
ran away from home.

695
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,817
She suddenly came to Korea.

696
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,194
Is that why…

697
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,989
That's why I came to Korea,

698
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,951
took the KMLE, and got a job here.

699
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,873
Her name is So-won.

700
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,210
I like her a lot.

701
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,796
But suddenly, she changed.

702
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:59,384
I think she started to lose her way

703
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,053
after our mother passed away.

704
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,931
I think…

705
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,810
I would feel the same way.

706
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,980
If my mom were gone,

707
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,650
I'd probably lose my way too.

708
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,487
But you'd still have
your father and sister.

709
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,490
That's true.

710
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,076
I'd feel lost for a while

711
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,038
but slowly find my way back.

712
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,792
My sister…

713
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,506
seems to be having
a hard time finding her way back.

714
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,389
She was adopted,
but she no longer wants to be

715
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,893
a member of our family.

716
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:05,158
So that's what you meant when you said
there was something you had to do here.

717
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,090
There's this feeling…

718
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,677
that's always inside me.

719
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,723
Everyone in my family is kind to me,
and I also live a hard-working life.

720
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,310
But deep down inside,

721
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:36,064
I always feel anxious…

722
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,276
because I was adopted.

723
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,822
Your sister

724
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,951
probably feels something similar.

725
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,956
So it might be her way of rebelling.

726
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:58,712
Thank you.

727
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,255
For what?

728
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,173
I'm sure it wasn't easy to tell me that.

729
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,760
Thank you for sharing it with me.

730
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,100
Gosh, I was feeling

731
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,477
really depressed today.

732
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,313
But you really cheered me up.

733
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,231
Well…

734
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,567
You know…

735
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,445
I felt bad

736
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,490
that I called us an accident.

737
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,580
You see,

738
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,750
I'm not used to

739
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:41,004
telling people about myself like this.

740
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,922
I've actually never done this.

741
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:48,887
But for some reason,
I find myself telling you everything.

742
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,767
I felt that way from the start.

743
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:58,188
I think it was because
you told me that your sister…

744
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,899
was adopted from Onnuri.

745
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:05,904
And you seemed like a good guy,

746
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,323
which was probably why

747
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,409
that happened…

748
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,122
that day…

749
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:20,043
Anyway, what I want to say is
that it wasn't an accident.

750
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:29,427
In my case, it was the moment
I saw you in front of the flower shop.

751
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,056
When I saw you there
with peonies in your hands,

752
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,017
I wanted to take you with me.

753
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,649
Seriously?

754
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,485
-You sound like a playboy.
-No, I mean…

755
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,821
Weird, right?
I felt that the moment I saw you.

756
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,155
Do you do this often?

757
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,783
No. I was really shocked.

758
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,285
I couldn't believe what I was saying.

759
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,954
I was worried I might get slapped.

760
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,163
-I was so nervous.
-Maybe…

761
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,082
Maybe I should've slapped you.

762
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,295
Anyway, I must say,

763
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,006
it was a very odd day.

764
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,060
Just a second.

765
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,941
Hey.

766
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,403
Nothing much.

767
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,281
Again?

768
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:41,708
How should I put it?
You look really awkward.

769
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,128
You're not good at sports.

770
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,255
-Don't I look cool?
-How exactly?

771
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,923
I was a track athlete
in elementary school.

772
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,468
That's irrelevant.

773
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,553
I'm saying I'm good at sports.

774
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,805
I'm serious. You look weird.

775
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,975
But is this supposed to be fun?

776
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,519
This is just unfair.

777
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,647
I can't believe you're the ones

778
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,775
who are always waiting for me
in front of my house.

779
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,069
Why? Were you hoping to see Seon-u?

780
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,156
It looks like you already drank a bit.

781
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,617
Yes. At the clinic.

782
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,243
What? Alone?

783
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,037
Goodness.

784
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,872
I have a feeling she wasn't alone.

785
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,083
-Was it with…
-Mi-hyeon?

786
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,755
Why would I drink
with my sister after work?

787
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,673
But you didn't drink alone.

788
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,009
Was it with Kim Seon-u?

789
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,261
We just drank a little bit.

790
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,263
My gosh.

791
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,183
You two are unbelievable.

792
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,520
-What?
-You two doctors are wild.

793
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,356
What are you imagining?

794
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,235
You know what?
The sofa in the lobby is pretty big.

795
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,153
-My gosh.
-Gosh, I just pictured it.

796
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,405
Are you crazy?

797
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,157
The first time is always hard,

798
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:59,118
but it gets easier
after a couple more times.

799
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,037
-Goodness.
-Unbelievable.

800
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,540
You embarrass me.

801
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,709
WATCH
DID YOU GET HOME SAFELY?

802
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,388
-Show us.
-Why?

803
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,348
There are no secrets between us.

804
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,558
What about my privacy?

805
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,101
You have none.

806
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,310
Show us.

807
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,272
-Come on. Show us.
-Hey.

808
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,274
-It's unlocked.
-Hey!

809
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,359
-Hey!
-Is it from Kim Seon-u?

810
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,652
"Did you get home safely?"

811
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,238
"Thank you for the car and the wine."

812
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,157
What? That's it?

813
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,242
Yes.

814
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,368
I said nothing happened.

815
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,245
Be honest.

816
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,290
-Are you a little disappointed?
-No.

817
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,791
Are you going to text him back?

818
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,711
-Of course.
-Right?

819
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:50,920
-Hey!
-Let me.

820
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,631
-Hey, stop it!
-I'll do it.

821
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,174
-Hey, stop.
-Hello?

822
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,551
Are you nuts?

823
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,804
You're out of your mind.

824
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,727
-He's calling.
-He's calling you.

825
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:07,812
He's calling.

826
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,023
-He's calling you. Pick up.
-Go on.

827
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,567
-It's okay.
-Pick up.

828
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,569
-Be quiet.
-We will.

829
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,240
Hello?

830
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,327
Did you get home safely?

831
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:28,249
I was going to text you back,

832
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,501
but I accidentally called you.

833
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:33,504
Yes. I'm home.

834
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:37,258
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow at the clinic.

835
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,301
Bye.

836
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,146
It wasn't me.

837
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,441
<i>You know it wasn't me, right?</i>

838
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,942
Cell phones have really good

839
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,903
-<i>Oh, dear.</i>
-sound quality these days.

840
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,780
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

841
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:00,573
Well, I want to believe you.

842
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,450
But I'm having second thoughts.

843
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,868
<i>I'll explain tomorrow.</i>

844
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,453
<i>-See you tomorrow.
-Explain what?</i>

845
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,621
Have a relieving night.

846
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,789
<i>I swear it wasn't me.</i>

847
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,462
She didn't use honorifics.

848
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,009
Come in.

849
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,435
I figured

850
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,145
you might laugh.

851
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,022
So let me explain.

852
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,190
Here.

853
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,653
You mean how you said, "It wasn't me"?

854
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,781
I forgot to use honorifics
because I was flustered.

855
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,366
It was friendly. I liked it.

856
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,327
No, I'm serious. It wasn't me.

857
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,121
Don't worry about it. It's okay.

858
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,123
No, it really wasn't me.

859
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,749
Gosh. Come in.

860
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,627
You're both here.

861
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,796
How about a welcome dinner
for Dr. Kim tonight?

862
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,214
I'd love that.

863
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,801
-How about you, Dr. Cha?
-I have plans.

864
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,011
With the duo
who also couldn't get married?

865
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,056
We chose not to get married.
It was by choice.

866
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,475
Sure. Whatever you say.

867
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,477
I'll see you both at dinner then.

868
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,564
Why did she even ask
if she was going to force me to go?

869
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,986
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

870
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,821
-Welcome.
-Are we going to have

871
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,906
a goodbye party for Dr. Cha too?

872
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,199
This can't be it, right?

873
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,661
I hear that all of you
are happy about Dr. Cha's sabbatical.

874
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,371
-Gosh.
-Does it show, Ms. Cha?

875
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:32,623
Totally.
Even more, now that Dr. Kim is here.

876
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:35,293
Come on.
We're not disloyal like that, Ms. Cha.

877
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:36,419
-She's right.
-Right.

878
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:38,796
You guys rarely make coffee for me,

879
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,549
but I noticed you guys
always make some for Dr. Kim.

880
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,800
I'm hurt.

881
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,261
I told you guys not to be too obvious.

882
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:46,888
She's upset now.

883
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:49,265
-We love you.
-We love you, Dr. Cha.

884
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,975
-We mean it.
-Forget it.

885
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,685
Cheers.

886
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,395
Don't drink alone.

887
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,939
-Whatever.
-Come on.

888
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,566
-She's sulking.
-Cheers.

889
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,360
-Dr. Kim, don't drink by yourself.
-Come on.

890
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,864
-Bye, Dr. Kim.
-Bye.

891
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,824
-Goodbye.
-Come on.

892
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,743
-I don't want to go.
-Go home safely.

893
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,077
-Bye.
-Go home safely.

894
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,412
Let's drink again.

895
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,247
-Okay.
-Okay, sure.

896
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,832
-Bye.
-Careful.

897
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,334
Please take her home safely.

898
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,503
-Bye.
-Bye.

899
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,462
Goodbye.

900
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,797
Let's have a goodbye party.

901
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,882
-Don't forget, okay?
-See you tomorrow.

902
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,801
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

903
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,805
Dr. Kim, how are you going to go home?

904
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,185
Come here.

905
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,978
Where are we going?

906
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,276
Do you not have peonies?

907
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,696
Not many people buy them.

908
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,948
Do you like peonies?

909
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,115
Yes.

910
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,409
Let's go already.
She needs to go home too.

911
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,286
-She loves peonies.
-What's with you?

912
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,664
-But you don't have any.
-I'm sorry.

913
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:56,123
Let's just go.

914
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,417
What a shame.

915
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,297
The fact that you're trying to buy me
peonies at this hour makes me

916
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,049
question your ulterior motives.

917
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,136
That's ridiculous.
I don't have any ulterior motives.

918
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:13,558
So let's go home already. I'm sleepy.

919
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,521
Do you really have to go to the States?

920
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:23,860
Yes.

921
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,950
Can't you just…

922
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:33,995
play golf here?

923
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,208
Just work two days a week.
The rest, you can play golf.

924
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,044
That's five days a week
including the weekends.

925
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:46,215
I'll play with you on the weekends.
I'm pretty good.

926
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,467
I already have
many people I can play with.

927
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,554
Your friends?

928
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,848
No, not them. They don't play.

929
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,478
Why do you have to go abroad to play golf?

930
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,856
Are you trying
to become a professional golfer?

931
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,402
Why does it sound like you're whining?

932
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,783
Come on.

933
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,037
Do you really not
get what I mean, Dr. Cha?

934
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,623
Are you dumb?

935
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:19,916
I'm not dumb.

936
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,417
Yes, you are.

937
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,419
How did you get into med school?

938
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,171
You must be out of your mind.

939
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,801
What I'm saying is my life
used to be so calm and quiet,

940
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,428
-but you showed up,
-What?

941
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,431
and now I'm completely into you!

942
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,769
And this is how you tell me?

943
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,606
Shouldn't you at least be calm about it?

944
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,151
How can I be calm about it?
I haven't felt like this in ten years.

945
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,237
But you're fleeing to the States.

946
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,198
"Flee"?

947
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,868
Yes. I don't know. I messed up, damn it.

948
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:00,998
Gosh.

949
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,752
What's going on?

950
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,172
Am I the one who's drunk?

951
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,426
What am I supposed to say?

952
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,556
I…

953
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,394
I just confessed my feelings for you.

954
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,108
Is it okay…

955
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:29,694
if I like you?

956
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,164
You're coming back after a year.

957
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,082
Right?

958
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,505
We're too drunk.

959
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,382
We both drank way too much.

960
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,720
I guess I'm a bit drunk.

961
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,724
I'll ask you out again
after I get some sleep

962
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,101
and sober up.

963
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,191
What?

964
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,526
Taxi.

965
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,029
My gosh.

966
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,080
He must've been out of his mind.

967
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,670
Who confesses their feelings like that?

968
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:34,467
Where did it all go wrong?
I can't believe I said it like that.

969
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,097
Gosh. Whatever.

970
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,907
I woke up early at dawn

971
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:00,242
and went to the flower market
in Yangjae-dong.

972
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:08,334
I didn't expect you
to go this far to apologize.

973
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,627
I'm a bit taken aback.

974
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,630
I didn't get those to apologize.

975
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,390
It's to finish the confession
I started yesterday.

976
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,313
Have a good day.

977
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,823
He's so incoherent.

978
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,553
Hey.

979
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,390
Yes. I'm about to start work.

980
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,602
Really? The results came out fast.

981
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,813
Yes.

982
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,277
Okay.

983
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,366
What do you mean?

984
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,673
Dr. Cha, what's wrong?

985
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:40,801
I don't think I can treat patients today.

986
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,220
Please take care of them for me.

987
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,388
Okay.

988
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:46,849
Dr. Cha.

989
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,617
I think she was worried
when she got the sonogram results.

990
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:06,744
She even took a CT scan.

991
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,454
Didn't she tell you?

992
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,748
No, she didn't.

993
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,417
She'll need to take a test to be sure,

994
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,794
but I think it's stage four.

995
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,880
You can't tell just by the CT scan.

996
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,382
I've seen this in one of my patients.

997
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,759
Bring her here.

998
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,261
She needs to get a PET scan
to see if it has spread.

999
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,723
Are you sure this is the right one?

1000
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,475
Are you sure it's hers?

1001
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:31,560
Mi-jo.

1002
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,405
How the hell could she
not have known until now?

1003
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,825
Damn it.

1004
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,593
PEONY

1005
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,937
<i>The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…</i>

1006
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:21,860
Come in.

1007
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,698
How is Dr. Cha?

1008
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,199
She won't pick up.

1009
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,536
This has never happened before.

1010
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,563
JIN-SEOK

1011
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,024
Hey, Jin-seok.

1012
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:01,525
<i>Are you on your way?</i>

1013
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,861
Oh, right.

1014
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,738
<i>You forgot?</i>

1015
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,699
I'm sorry. I'll be right there.

1016
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:11,952
<i>Then just come to my office.
We can drink someplace nearby.</i>

1017
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:12,870
Okay.

1018
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:05,631
{\an8}CEO KIM JIN-SEOK

1019
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:06,757
{\an8}Is Mi-jo nice to you?

1020
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,635
Yes, she's really kind.

1021
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,887
Are you sure?
I bet you're the one who's nice.

1022
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:14,056
Right?

1023
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,227
Mi-jo, what…

1024
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,480
I'll kill you.

1025
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:26,735
You!

1026
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,780
I'll kill you!

1027
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,908
Kim Jin-seok…

1028
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,203
You jerk!

1029
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,289
Mi-jo, what's wrong?

1030
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,212
I'm going to kill you.

1031
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:39,057
<i>I don't know</i>

1032
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:44,062
<i>why I ran over to see Jin-seok
instead of Chan-young that day.</i>

1033
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,733
It's your fault.

1034
01:14:49,109 --> 01:14:50,527
It's all because of you.

1035
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,489
It's your fault,

1036
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:56,283
and it's my fault too.

1037
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,205
It's all because of us.

1038
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,626
Mi-jo, what…

1039
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:12,109
<i>And that day…</i>

1040
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:16,613
<i>when everything felt hopeless,</i>

1041
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,952
<i>the touch of his hand…</i>

1042
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:25,872
<i>felt so warm.</i>

1043
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,578
{\an8}<i>Twenty-nine.</i>

1044
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,288
{\an8}<i>What did you like at that age?</i>

1045
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,332
{\an8}<i>My friends.</i>

1046
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:10,334
{\an8}<i>Let's run.</i>

1047
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:15,380
{\an8}I had no idea what to say to her.

1048
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,385
{\an8}When I share my troubles
with someone unrelated…

1049
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,511
{\an8}It helps lift a burden off my chest.

1050
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:23,930
{\an8}<i>What he and I have…</i>

1051
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,684
{\an8}is not what you think.

1052
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,311
{\an8}Won't you be embarrassed when you die?

1053
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:31,813
{\an8}I guess it's bad.

1054
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,691
{\an8}We're still in our thirties.

1055
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,818
{\an8}<i>We still have so much left to enjoy.</i>
